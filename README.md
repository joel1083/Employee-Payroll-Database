# Employee Payroll Database

## Program Specifications:  
- An employer would like to maintain a linked list for employees, the data stored is
- An employee number (a positive integer)
- A yearly salary (a float). 

- **The employer would like you as the programmer design and implement a linked list using classes. For each class two files are needed, one to define the class, the other to implement the methods. In addition, the client uses a menu driven program with options to handle choices (methods).** 

## The program should include the following methods:
1)	Insert: Which inserts elements at the beginning of the list, which is the most recent input is at the beginning of the list.

2)	Remove: which deletes the last element in the list.

3)	Display: its purpose is to display the list but needs the assistance of a Print function.

4)	Print: a recursive function that prints all the elements of the list, first to last.

5)	Clear: a recursive function that deletes every Node from the list and leaves the list empty. 

## Program grading requirements:

•	Define a class Node containing the employee’s data and a pointer to the next Node.

•	Define the necessary functions to access, instantiate, and set the data in the class Node.

•	Define a class LinkedList that has only one data member, a pointer to a Node, and the necessary member functions in addition to the member functions above.
